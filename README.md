# Cucumber-Exercise-Passion-Tea

This repo contains an exercise that demonstrate the use of Selinium and Cucumber to automate front end testing. 

The task is to test the website to identify if key features are working like "Shopping on a website". These features are then broken down into different scenarious like "Browse items available on the website". 

Each scenario is followed up with a "Given, When and Then" statement. This pesudo code approach is a great approach to organising code, it also helps incorporate the principles of Behaviour Driven Testing. 

The "Given, When, Then" syntax is also useful for developing features and also when creating project management boards.
